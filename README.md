SMART DUSTBIN USING ARDUINO is an IOT based project. Here we are using arduino for code execution, for sensing we used ultrasonic sensor which will open lid and wait for few moment. So this help in maintaining the environment clean with the help of technology. It is a sensor based dustbin so it would be easy to access use for any age group. Our aim is also to make it cost effective so that many numbers of people can get the benefit from this. And it should be usable to anyone and helpful for them.
